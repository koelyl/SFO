# SFO Airport Survey

## Background

Note: This project is a work in progress.

Surveys can impart insights into how people think and behave--a topic that's of endless interest to me as a social science researcher. Travel data like this often adds a lovely geographic dimension so we can explore how opinions and demographics disperse themselves through space. 

We begin by loading, cleaning and transforming the data. Next we'll explore using visualizations and descriptive statistics, and finish with analysis and interpretation. This iterative process tends to yield many interesting analysis topics which, for the sake of limiting scope, are included under future research. I encourage the curious and enterprising reader to fork this repository and explore these and other thought-provoking questions in this dataset. 

## Browser View Option (no download required)
* Simply scroll up to the list of files above this README and click on "SFO Analysis.ipynb". You should be redirected to a new page, where the notebook will load shortly. 

## Installation Option (for developers) 

### Downloading data (in progress)
* Clone this repo to your computer.
* Change into the folder using `cd SFO-Airport-Survey` in the terminal. 

You can also download the original datafiles from [here](https://www.flysfo.com/media/customer-survey-data), compliments of San Francisco International Airport. 

### Install the requirements
* Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  * This project uses Python 2.7
  * You may want to use a virtual environment for this. 

### Usage (in progress)
* Use the terminal to run `jupyter notebook` from the SFO-Airport-Survey directory. The notebook will launch in your browser at `localhost:8888`. 

## Extending this/future research
* Explore trends over time by interpolating past years' survey data. 
* Distribution of destinations by demographic (age, gender, income, etc)
* Reason for travel by destination and demographic
* Explore transportation method to SFO by zip code
